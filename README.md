# FinTech and My Perspective

In the realm of financial technology, often abbreviated as FinTech, lies a rapidly evolving landscape characterized by disruption and innovation. FinTech represents a transformative force, reshaping the conventional methodologies in financial services. This evolution is not just a technological shift but also embodies the 'Kaizen' philosophy of continuous improvement, a concept originating from Japan, which significantly impacts the financial sector.

My interest in FinTech is particularly piqued by its potential to revolutionize traditional financial models. Areas such as Credit Underwriting in Crowdlending, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models, and Pay-As-You-Go systems exemplify the dynamic nature of FinTech, showcasing how technology can enhance accessibility and efficiency in financial services.

As I delve deeper into the FinTech world, my objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the diverse FinTech landscapes. This exploration is aimed at identifying the area which resonates most with my interests and aspirations, allowing me to focus my efforts and develop expertise in that specific niche.

Despite my enthusiasm for FinTech's economic aspects, stemming from my background in economics, I find certain technical aspects challenging. The intricacies of building Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and the secure storage and trading of cryptocurrencies are areas that I find particularly perplexing. However, the statistical analysis within FinTech aligns well with my economic knowledge, drawing clear connections between these two domains.

In conclusion, while certain aspects of FinTech, particularly its technological underpinnings, pose challenges to my understanding, the field's alignment with economics and its potential for innovation and improvement in financial services deeply interest me. As I progress in my FinTech journey, I anticipate gaining clarity and proficiency in these areas, leveraging my economic background to navigate and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of financial technology.
