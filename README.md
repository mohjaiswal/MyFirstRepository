# FinTech and Me

So far, today has been all about course introductions and lectures. Now it's time to reflect a bit about the following question: what does FinTech mean to you?

## Instructions

Answer the following questions:

* What does FinTech mean to you? Why is it important?

    It is providing a financial service through disruption or innovation in financial technologies. It means having freedom of choice to make financial         decisions in a timely and effective manner.

* What about FinTech interests you?

    Credit Underwriting for Crowdlending, P2P lending models and Pay-As-You-Go models.

* Where do you expect FinTech to take you? What are you looking to do?

    Understand different types of fintechs and develop my interest towards the one that is most attractive to me

* What about FinTech may be confusing? What makes sense?

    Building APIs is confusing to me as well as safely storing and trading crypto. Statistical analysis makes sense to me. I have an economics background       and see a linkage between fintech and economics. But what confuses me is the techonology side of things; clearly. 

Write down your answers and keep them somewhere safe. In the future, we will look back at your responses to see how much you've accomplished!
